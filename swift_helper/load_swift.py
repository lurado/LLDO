  Loads definitions from a `.swift` file.
  
  Usage: load_swift </path/to/file.swift>
  
  Load the contents of file at the given path and evaluates it in the context of the current debugger context.
  However LLDB expression evaluation is scoped. 
  So definitions from one expression evaluation don't carry over to the next one.
  That means any types or functions defined in your Swift files won't be available to you after you loaded them.
  But there are two ways to work around this.
  First: Everything that's prefixed with `$` will be added to the global scope and be available after the evaluation ended.
  Unfortunately Swift does not allow function or type names to start with a `$` (outside LLDB) and throws many errors which makes working in Xcode rather unpleasant and pretty much pointless.
  Which leaves option two: Put everything into extensions as they also outlive their direct evaluation scope.

  Loads the Swift runtime.

  Since all helpers are written in Swift, the Swift runtime is required to run them.
  However the runtime might not be loaded into LLDB yet, if the application hasn't been stopped in a Swift stack frame.
  Or the runtime will not be loaded at all in pure Objective-C applications.

  This command loads all necessary Swift .dylibs into the current process.
  Already loaded libs will be skipped.

  Attention: Only works in the Simulator!

  To our knowledge it's not possible to transfer a library onto the device and load it from there.
  That means pure Objective-C apps need to add a single unused Swift file, to bundle the Swift runtime into the app.
  It will then be auto loaded during startup.
